This directory contains scripts to train a CENsible model. We provide these
scripts as a convenience and for reproducibility's sake. You may need to modify
them to work on your computer system.

The scripts are numbered in the order they should be run:

- `1.downloads.md`
- `2.process_pdbbind.bash`
- `3.make_regular_types_file.py`
- `4.add_smina_types.py`
- `5.make_gninatypes.bash`
- `6.make_molcache2.bash`
- `7.finalize_random_splits.py`
- `8.get_smina_ordered_terms.sh`
- `9.train_on_random_splits.bash`
- `10.make_independent_splits.py`
- `11.train_on_independent_splits.bash`
